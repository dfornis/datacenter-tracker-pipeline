  <p>This page tracks publicly reported plans for new datacenter projects in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The dataset is being developed for an upcoming research article estimating the impact of datacenter load additions on electricity prices in Nordic bidding zones. The tracker compiles publicly reported project information from press releases, media reports, permitting documents and company material.</p>
  <p>The Nordic countries are currently attracting substantial interest from datacenter developers due to cheap renewable electricity, climate conditions and land availability. I'm sharing the dataset here as a public resource and to open the project for comments and suggestions. The methodology is still under development. In particular, I am working on improving how heterogeneous reported MW figures should be interpreted, and how PUE and annual load factors should be assigned. Corrections, missing projects, better source material and methodological comments are very welcome, please send them to <a href="mailto:fornborg@kth.se">fornborg@kth.se</a>.</p>

**Using the map.** The scenario sets the blue shading of each bidding zone and the MW figures below the map. Shading uses the upper value of the quantified capacity. Coloured points match the scenario and HQ selection. Other points stay light grey. All points are solid and stay in place when you change the selection. Click a point for its scenario contribution and any missing information. The map follows the table's country, zone, status and type filters. The table keeps all projects.

**How to read the scenarios.** Scenario values estimate how much new datacenter capacity could be operating in the target year. Dates are applied only to the capacity they explicitly describe. For example, a first building's opening date does not date the rest of a larger campus. A phase with unknown MW remains an explicit information gap; it does not date or quantify the entire campus.

First operation uses a scoped source date, otherwise construction plus a stated build time, otherwise remaining lead times from the current implementation stage. Grid restrictions constrain delivery. A scoped full-build target takes precedence over generic durations; the inferred ramp is shortened when needed. It cannot create unobserved historical commissioning. Unknown or staged buildout uses a provisional five-year capacity ramp; a known single-phase delivery uses its own date. These are physical-capacity assumptions, separate from the annual electricity-use factor. Ranges reflect uncertainty in the MW measure, PUE, source range or timing.

**Developer headquarters.** Use the **HQ** buttons to select **Domestic**, **Other Europe** or **Outside Europe** actors. Matching projects in the scenario turn orange. Projects with unknown MW also turn orange when their HQ matches. Other points stay light grey. The area shading and MW figures below the map follow the same HQ selection. **All** restores the full scenario. The HQ choice stays selected when you switch scenario.

Domestic means an actor has its global headquarters in the project's country. Other Europe means that an actor is headquartered in a different European country. Outside Europe means that an actor is headquartered beyond Europe. Projects with several actors can match more than one group. Totals use each selected project's modelled capacity once.

A dash in the HQ-filtered figures means headquarters have not been reviewed for that country. Unknown capacity remains unknown.

\* Some projects in the selection have no MW estimate. The displayed total covers only quantified capacity.

The classification uses global headquarters. Ownership is described separately in the project details. The method below explains how headquarters were identified.

## Capacity and electricity use

**Full build-out (MW)** is the total site power of the whole project if everything announced is built, including cooling and other site electricity use. Where the source states total site power or a grid connection, that figure is used as reported. Capacity explicitly stated as IT power is converted to site power with PUE 1.1–1.5 (or a reported design PUE). When the source does not specify what its MW figure measures, the source value or range is preserved without PUE conversion. Overlapping phases are counted once. A known operating baseline is subtracted; verified additions after 2025 remain in the annual history when their status becomes Operational. A project that is part of a larger campus is counted there and shows "In campus" instead of a separate figure. Expand the row to see which campus.

**Electricity at full build-out (TWh/yr)** is full build-out × the annual load factor for the facility type × 8,760 hours. It expresses the project's full size as annual electricity use.

Expand a project to see the source figures and whether they describe IT equipment, total site power or a grid connection, along with phase dates, decisions and sources. A decision to build one phase applies to that phase. It does not establish a decision for the entire campus. Backup generators and power generation are not counted as datacenter load.

IT capacity is converted to total site capacity using PUE assumptions of 1.1–1.5, with a reported local design PUE used where available. Annual electricity use uses load factors of 0.75 for hyperscale, 0.57 for colocation, 0.60 for colocation with AI, and 0.80 for AI/HPC. The assumptions draw on [EPRI (2026)](https://powering-intelligence.epri.com/annual-peak-use.html), [IEA (2025)](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai) and the documented model method.

## How the tracker is updated

Each country update follows the same sequence from initial lead to published scenario result. The steps below explain what information is collected, how separate projects and phases are identified, and how the source material becomes the figures shown in the table and map.

<div class="tracker-workflow">
  <details>
    <summary><span class="workflow-step">01</span><span>Search for new capacity</span></summary>
    <div class="workflow-body">
      <p>A rules-based search routine works through each country using a documented codebook. It combines operator and customer names with place names, capacity terms, construction stages and grid terminology. The search covers company announcements, planning and permit records, grid information, local reporting and other public sources.</p>
      <p>A lead moves forward when the sources connect a named datacenter operator or end customer to a specific location and a new capacity addition. The source trail and unresolved questions are retained for the next step.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><span class="workflow-step">02</span><span>Reconcile identity, phases and dates</span></summary>
    <div class="workflow-body">
      <p>The lead is compared with existing projects, candidate records and historic names. Addresses, municipalities, land parcels, company relationships and earlier announcements help determine whether it is a new project, a new phase or another name for an existing campus.</p>
      <p>Campus owners, operators, tenants and individual buildings are linked without merging their evidence. Each phase keeps the MW figure, date and investment decision stated for that phase. This prevents the timing of a first building from being applied to the whole campus and keeps tenant capacity from being counted twice.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><span class="workflow-step">03</span><span>Record what each source actually measures</span></summary>
    <div class="workflow-body">
      <p>Every capacity claim is recorded with its unit, scope and qualifier. IT equipment load, total site electricity use and grid connection capacity remain distinct. The record also keeps the source's range, project status, timing and investment decision, together with the part of the campus or phase to which they apply.</p>
      <p>Conflicting figures are represented as a range when the evidence supports one. Missing figures remain unknown. A statement such as “at least X MW” is preserved as source evidence but does not define the project's full size unless an upper figure is also available. A separately quantified phase can still be used.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><span class="workflow-step">04</span><span>Calculate and review the scenarios</span></summary>
    <div class="workflow-body">
      <p>The scenarios estimate how much new datacenter capacity is operating in the target year. Scoped phase schedules take precedence. Where the buildout is unknown, a provisional five-year capacity ramp fills the gap; a single-phase delivery uses its own date. A source full-build target is honored over that proxy.</p>
      <ul class="workflow-scenarios">
        <li><strong>Low 2030</strong> uses capacity with a confirmed investment decision and a date for that same phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Stated 2030</strong> uses the announced date for each capacity figure and calculates the share operating by 2030.</li>
        <li><strong>Stated 2035</strong> uses the same method with 2035 as the target year.</li>
        <li><strong>High 2035</strong> includes every active plan. Dated capacity follows its project date. Capacity without a date follows explicit early and late lead times from its implementation stage, subject to applicable grid restrictions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes sources confirm that a first phase is going ahead but give no MW figure for it. That phase remains an explicit unknown. Its date does not bring the campus total into Low or Stated, and the campus MW are not used as the phase size.</p>
      <p>New records enter as candidates. Their identity, evidence and scenario effect are reviewed before inclusion in the totals. One approved calculation feeds the data export, annual chart, summary, table and map.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><span class="workflow-step">05</span><span>Identify actors and global headquarters</span></summary>
    <div class="workflow-body">
      <p>Project announcements and site-specific sources identify the developer, operator, named customer and, where relevant, property owner or project partner. Each actor is linked to the whole project, including its phases. Partnerships keep separate actors and roles.</p>
      <p>Global headquarters are checked against company reports, official contact pages and company announcements, with other reliable sources used when needed. A local subsidiary's registered address or a regional office does not establish the group's global HQ. Registration country, headquarters, fund manager and financial owners are recorded separately. The business type describes what the actor does.</p>
      <p>Ownership notes retain the source and date. They describe the documented ownership without assigning an owner nationality or tracing every investor. Unknown identities and HQ countries remain unknown and do not match any HQ group. A project can still match a known partner's HQ while another actor is unresolved. Expand the project for actors, roles, HQ, sources and the review date.</p>
      <p>The reviews cover 31 Swedish, 46 Finnish and 32 Norwegian projects as of 17 October 2026. Every relevant actor has a known HQ country for 30 Swedish, 42 Finnish and 30 Norwegian projects. The remaining cases include an anonymous operator, a company with two headquarters and actors that do not publish one global HQ. HQ selection filters the map and its totals without allocating capacity between actors.</p>
